    <p style ="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align:left; font-weight:200;line-height:18px">Korea is now the only divided country in the world. The division of the Korean peninsula was not our choice but imposed on us. It was the outcome of superpower conflict and we are the greatest victim of the cold war. There are thousands of families who have not seen each other for decades. The continuing division of the Korean peninsula poses a serious threat to peace, not only in Korea itself, but even the world.<br><br>

Unification has long been the ultimate goal of the two Koreas. We all hope that peace can finally come to Korea. If that happens, what would a unified Korea look like? How long would unification take? How would it take place? Would it be beneficial for both Koreas? Would it be good or bad? Is a unified Korea even possible?<br><br>

      What would Korean unification look like? How do you feel about it?<br><br><br><br></p></left>
